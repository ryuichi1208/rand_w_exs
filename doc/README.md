Source Code Layout

* Use two spaces per indentation level. No hard tabs.
* Use Unix-style line endings (*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are covered by default, Windows users have to be extra careful).
* Run single-line defs that match for the same function together, but separate multiline defs with a blank line.
